Greetings!

I'm Fernando (FernandoCB11) a **Machine Learning Engineer** from **Brazil**. I've been working with software engineering and development for more than 8 years, and since 2021, specifically in Machine Learning Engineering.

I’m also a Master of Science  student, in the final steps of my Masters thesis, the **Application of classifier ensembles in the identification of exoplanet transits on low signal-to-noise data** where I joined two of my great passions, artificial intelligence and astronomy.

Lately, I’ve taken a real interest in AWS services and python development.
